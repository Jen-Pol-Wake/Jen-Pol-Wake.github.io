# About me.

Hi! I'm Jen and I live in Cary, NC with my husband and our two cats Agatha "Aggie" Christie and C.S. "Lewie" Lewis, named after two of my favorite authors.  I have a minor in Classical Civilization, a BA in History, and a Master's Degree in Library and Information Science.  I am a "forever" student currently taking classes to learn more about all things data management.  

## Here are some interesting things about me and how I spend my time:
 - I love reading and being surrounded by books.
 - I enjoy cooking and collecting historical cookbooks.
 - I am naturally curious and my newest goal is to learn big data management and coding.

 ## Here are some interesting and resourceful websites that have helped me personally and professionally:
 - [Wolfram](https://www.wolfram.com/?source=nav)   - _Wolfram_ really fascinates me because the data visualizations are wonderful. Wolfram code is used at research institutions, and the documentation is organized well and reads easily.  _[Here's a great example of a detailed physics data visualization](https://www.wolframphysics.org/visual-gallery/0015-dark/WolframPhysicsProject-0015-dark-medium.png)._
 - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)   _W3 Schools_ is a perfect resource for learning various data analytics tools and popular coding languages with their libraries.  It also offers simple visual examples, easy to read charts, and interactive quizzes.
 - [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/)  - _Getty Images_ is a curated resource from the Getty Research Institute, I have used Getty for over a decade.  The site has royalty-free stock images and videos, there are thousands to choose from as well as an archive.
 - [Codex Atlanticus](https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/) - _Codex Atlanticus_ is the largest collection of Leonardo Da Vinci's drawings and texts.  The collection is easy to navigate.  It is categorized and color coded by 5 main subjects and their combinations:
 
     > Physics and Natural Sciences is _[Yellow](https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Detail?detail=211)_,
     > Geometry and Algebra is _[Green](https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Detail?detail=259)_,
     > Tools and Machines is _[Salmon](https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Detail?detail=51)_,
     > Architecture and Applied Arts is _[Blue](https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Detail?detail=130)_, and 
     > Human Science is _[Red](https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Detail?detail=657)_.  Enjoy exploring!
